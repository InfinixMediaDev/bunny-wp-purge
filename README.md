# bunny-wp-purge
WordPress Plugin Specifically ONLY for purging Bunny.net CDN Pull Zone Cache 

This is just a simple plugin simply for only Purging Bunny.net CDN Pull Zone Cache.

You need your Account API Key and a Pull Zone ID. 

Check your account settings for the API KEY. As for the Pull Zone ID you can see it on your address bar when accessing your pull zones in Bunny.net Dashboard.
For example : https://panel.bunny.net/pullzones/edit/3321321. It means that your Pull Zone ID is 3321321.

I intentionaly left this unbranded, just in case some people want to resell bunny.net cdn to their client and want to give them ability to clear the CDN Cache.
